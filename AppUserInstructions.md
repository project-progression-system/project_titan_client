2. Then the user will be presented with the main screen which shows the user's avatar, progress bar and avatar's name.
Currently a user can go to the main screen, AR mode or assignment history.

Then simply tap the screen to generate the 3D model/avatar. The user can also manipulate the model by moving, rotating and rescaling with simple gesture controls.
4. If the Assignment History item is selected from the navigation drawer, then a list view will display that shows a list of the assignment name and number points recieved from completion.
