As a teacher, you want an app that can incorporate your current curriculum in an easy-to-use,  stable, organized fashion that engages your students. Additionally, you want to keep data to track your students' progress with your coursework. Through the app, the teacher will be able to monitor the progress of each student in their classes and see how they're progressing. The teacher will be able to see if one or more of their students are excelling, falling behind, or are completing all the assignments on time. The teacher would be able to enter the game, having their avatar integrated within the game. The teacher will have administrator level access who can view all of the students' progress and only the teacher.

Imagine you're a student who has been assigned some homework and you are just receiving a grade that is boring and does not have any real meaning to you whereas you can see an avatar and earn items through completing tasks and assignments. As a kid, seeing your progression that is tangible and incorporates a fun element into it where you can engage in battles with your other classmates would be tremendous fun â€” competing and gathering items that you earn through completing assignments, quizzes, and tests and show off to your friends and parents, receiving the best things you can. Achieving a problematic item through completing your work is a gratifying feeling.
